This is a silly little tool that you pass your [Twitter archive] to, and
it generates a HTML page with some notable tweets from your history and
some of your more interesting followers.

Install with

```console
$ cargo install ornithology-cli
```

Run with

```console
$ ornithology path/to/twitter/archive
```

It should open your browser once to authenticate with Twitter, and once
to render the page with interesting tweets. See `--help` for more stuff
you can do. Here's [an example] for [my Twitter account].
